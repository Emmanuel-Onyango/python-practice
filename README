The following are brief explanations of my code in each of the .py files:

 1.factorial.py file
   I implemented the use of the base case, the known output when the factorial==0 or ==1 which ==1,
    and the recursive case whether the function calls itself upto the base case.

2.check if number is odd or even.py file
 The evenness or oddness of a number is called parity.I have passed the number whose parity is to be determined
  as a parameter followed by a simple if else statement to determine whether the number is even or odd by the use of
   modulus, which return the remainder of a number. If a number is divisible by 2, then it has no remainder, which means
    , the remainder is 0.

3.sum of  digits in a number.py file
 Created a variable to store the sum of the digits in a number,initialized to 0,  after iterating the string type-casted
   number  using a for loop.
    I  also passed a variable for the number in the function as a parameter to allow dynamic function use based on the
     argument passed during function call.

4.String reversal.py
 When a user inputs a  a string, there is an  if statement is  for file handling incase a user enters nothing and hits
  enter which terminates the program safely
   I then used an empty variable to store the reversed string after which I used a for loop  which iterates the reversal
    of the letters based on  name and length to know when to stop the iteration
     Reversed Letters are added and stored based on the index number of the letter
      for example, if one inputs Barcelona, the output will be anolecraB

 5.sum of elements in a list.py file
  initialized a  variable to 0 to store the sum of elements in the list
   passed the elements of the list as a parameter to allow dynamic use during function call with specific arguments
    if the list has numbers 1,2 and 8 the output will be 11
    for loop to iterate through the list
     the variable stores the sum of the elements after each iteration

6.Factorial using loop.py file
  The function calculates the factorial of a number using a for loop. I then initialized a variable to 1 to handle the
     (number-1)factorial part
      The range in combination with the store variable ensures that
       the 0 instance is well handled since x can never be zero, the last possible output is 1, because 0 factorial is 1
        The logic of the range starts from the number whose factorial is to be found product is stored after
         each iteration
          if one passes o as an argument, the output=1
